# pythonAPIassignment
1.It is based on Python Django.

2. I used Sql Server Database and perform all CRUD API operations:
python myapp.py
(myapp is a python file. It is suppose to be a third party app. It can be in any languages in my case it is in Python Language. Whenever you run this line  all CRUD API operation has performed.)

3. Registeration and login has done using API:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/register/
This is used for registration using api
http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/login/
This is used for login and also generated jwt token
http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/refresh-token/
This is used for refresh the token


4. Only authenticate user can perform.

5.JWT token generate only when you are successfully login.

API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Suppose we take a daily routine example:
Suppose we went to restaurant and we want to eat food and food cooks in a kitchen but we can’t go directly in the kitchen and order food. Waiter is the mediator between us and kitchen. Just like here API is the mediator between two applications.

There are so many APIs but basically in python Django REST API is vey famous.
REST stands for Representational transfer state. It is a archietectural guidelines to make APIs. The API which follows REST guidelines is known as REST API.
